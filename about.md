## About the Clean Campus Committee (CCC)

### Origins of the Committee
The Clean Campus Committee (CCC) was formed from a shared vision among students, faculty, and staff to proactively address and enhance the cleanliness, hygiene, and overall environmental quality of our esteemed Indian Institute of Technology campus. Recognizing that a clean and well-maintained environment is crucial for health, productivity, and a positive community spirit, the initiative was launched to bring a structured and collaborative approach to campus upkeep.

### Guiding Philosophy
Our guiding philosophy is rooted in the principles of:
*   **Collaboration:** We believe that a clean campus is a collective responsibility. We strive to engage all members of the IIT community – students, faculty, staff, and vendors – in our initiatives.
*   **Sustainability:** Our efforts are not just about temporary fixes but about instilling long-term sustainable practices in waste management, resource conservation, and environmental preservation.
*   **Awareness & Education:** We aim to educate and raise awareness about the importance of cleanliness, hygiene, and ecological balance, fostering a culture of respect for our shared spaces.
*   **Proactive Action:** We are committed to identifying potential issues, planning effective solutions, and implementing them efficiently across designated zones of the campus.
*   **Continuous Improvement:** We believe in regularly monitoring our progress, gathering feedback, and adapting our strategies to continuously improve the campus environment.
