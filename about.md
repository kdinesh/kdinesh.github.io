## About the Clean Campus Committee (CCC)

### Origins of the Committee
The Clean Campus Committee (CCC) was formed from a shared vision among students, faculty, and staff to proactively address and enhance the cleanliness, hygiene, and overall environmental quality of our esteemed Indian Institute of Technology campus. Recognizing that a clean and well-maintained environment is crucial for health, productivity, and a positive community spirit, the initiative was launched to bring a structured and collaborative approach to campus upkeep.

### Our Name, Logo, and Tagline

**Name of the Committee:**
The name "Clean Campus Committee" (CCC) was chosen for its directness and clarity of purpose. It immediately communicates our core mission: to ensure and promote a clean campus. The "Committee" aspect highlights our collaborative and organized approach, involving representatives and leads for various zones and activities.

**Tagline:**
*"Unity Through Purpose, Cleanliness Through Action"*
*(Or, if you prefer the pre-header statement: "A Clean Campus Inspires a Clear Mind.")*

This tagline emphasizes our belief that collective effort (Unity Through Purpose) leads to tangible results (Cleanliness Through Action). It calls upon every member of the community to join hands for a common goal.
